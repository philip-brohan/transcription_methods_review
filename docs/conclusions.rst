Conclusions and recommendations
===============================

The case studies included here are of seven successful transcription projects. We can divide them into several different groupings:

* By funding structure: Two large commercial contracts (:doc:`Royal Navy WW2 <case_studies/RN_WW2/RN_WW2>` and :doc:`East India Company <case_studies/EEIC/EEIC>`), against three citizen science projects (:doc:`oldWeather1&2 <case_studies/oldweather/oldweather1+2/oldweather1+2>`, :doc:`oldWeather3 <case_studies/oldweather/oldweather3/oldweather3>`, and :doc:`UK DWR stations <case_studies/DWR/DWR>`), and one academic small project group (:doc:`Marine expeditions <case_studies/Expeditions/Expeditions>`).
* By difficulty of source: contrast :doc:`Royal Navy WW2 <case_studies/RN_WW2/RN_WW2>` and :doc:`oldWeather1&2 <case_studies/oldweather/oldweather1+2/oldweather1+2>` (more modern, easy to read source documents) with :doc:`East India Company <case_studies/EEIC/EEIC>` and :doc:`oldWeather3 <case_studies/oldweather/oldweather3/oldweather3>` (older, hard to read source documents).
* By type of source data: contrast :doc:`UK DWR stations <case_studies/DWR/DWR>` (land station records) with all the others (marine observations).

Conclusions
-----------

For academic-scale projects, where transcription is a small part of the total work, including a transcriber in the project team works well.

Citizen science works works pretty much as well as large-scale commercial and has a much lower financial cost (contrast :doc:`Royal Navy WW2 <case_studies/RN_WW2/RN_WW2>` with :doc:`oldWeather1&2 <case_studies/oldweather/oldweather1+2/oldweather1+2>`, and :doc:`East India Company <case_studies/EEIC/EEIC>` with :doc:`oldWeather3 <case_studies/oldweather/oldweather3/oldweather3>`). It's also encouraging that citizen science has been successful not only with ship's logbooks (plenty of human interest) but also with the intrinsically less appealing data tables used for the :doc:`UK DWR stations <case_studies/DWR/DWR>`. A lot of the credit for the success of citizen science in this field is due to `Zooniverse <https://zooniverse.org>`_.

Participation rates in citizen science projects are sensitive to the difficulty of the exact task requested of the volunteers. Making the requested unit of work smaller - perhaps by presenting only a fragment of a page to be transcribed, rather than the whole thing, can increase participation a lot.

The speed, cost and efficiency of transcription depends most on the difficulty of the task: observations in hard-to-read older documents took several times as much time and effort to read as those in easier, more modern documents. (Contrast :doc:`oldWeather1&2 <case_studies/oldweather/oldweather1+2/oldweather1+2>` with :doc:`oldWeather3 <case_studies/oldweather/oldweather3/oldweather3>`, and :doc:`Royal Navy WW2 <case_studies/RN_WW2/RN_WW2>` with :doc:`East India Company <case_studies/EEIC/EEIC>`).

Transcription is fundamentally slow - speeds in these projects vary from 6 observations/minute to 1 observation every 3 minutes. It also consumes a lot of work -  from 0.2 to 2.2 person-minutes for each observation. This is the major current limitation: the number of observations remaining to be transcribed is unknown, but 1 billion (1,000,000,000) is a reasonable planning number. At typical rates shown above, this will take of order 100 years elapsed, (and 500 person-years effort). This is too long - we **must** :doc:`go faster <case_studies/automated_systems/automated_systems>`.

Document transcription is not a climate-specific problem - it is valuable to many fields. It's worth trying to get more people working on transcription in general, perhaps by emphasising its importance to climate research. 

Recommendations
---------------

For the smallest transcription tasks, just do it - get the transcription done by the project team.

For larger tasks, a citizen science project has a good chance of success - current best practice is exemplified by the :doc:`UK DWR stations <case_studies/DWR/DWR>` project. This can be excellent value for money, but don't underestimate the effort required in managing and marketing the project.

To get the job done, we need to come up with a much faster technique than anything that has been tried so far. In principle, we could run a much bigger citizen science project (or a family of projects), but it's not clear how to make them much bigger (so far we have not managed it) - we should encourage research in this area. An alternative approach is to come up with an :doc:`automated system <case_studies/automated_systems/automated_systems>` to do some or all of the job - we should encourage research in this area as well.
