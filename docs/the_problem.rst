The transcription problem
=========================

Actually it's more of an opportunity:

Everything we know about past climate change and variability depends upon access to observations of the climate system. Our current datasets contain large numbers of historical observations: For example the International Surface Pressure Databank (version 3.2.9) - used by the `20th Century Reanalysis (20CR) <https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/20thC_Rean>`_ contains :doc:`1,133,185,756 observations over the period 1851-2000 <figures/global_observations_count>`. However, these observations are not evenly distributed in space and time:

The limited number, and restricted geographical range, of observations available in earlier years is a major limitation on our ability to reconstruct past climate.

   Observations coverage and reconstructed weather (MSLP) uncertainty.

   Mean-sea-level pressure (mslp) as reconstructed by 20CR version 2c for 1953-02-01:06 (blue contours), and the pressure observations assimilated to make the reconstruction. A seperate contour plot is shown for each of the 56 ensemble members comprising 20CR2c - where these all agree we have confidence in the reconstruction, where the contours diverge the reconstruction is very uncertain. (:doc:`Figure source <figures/uncertainty_and_observations>`).

If we were able to generate many more observations, located in times and places where the current record has few or none, then we could make large improvements in our reconstructions of past climate. That's the opportunity, as many such observations were made, and records from them exist, on paper, in libraries and archives around the world [link to copernicus inventory]. `We need to rescue them - to convert them to digital database records <http://www.met-acre.net/data%20rescue.htm>`_.
