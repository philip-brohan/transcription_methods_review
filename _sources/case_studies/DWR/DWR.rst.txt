Summary
-------

This project extended the `citizen science <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science>`_ approach to transcription to station data. It set out to transcribe UK-region station observations from the `Daily Weather Reports <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/library/archive-hidden-treasures/daily-weather-reports>`_ for the period 1900-1910 (`sample page <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philip-brohan/transcription_methods_review/master/docs/case_studies/DWR/DWR_sample_page.jpg>`_). It was built on the `Zooniverse <https://zooniverse.org>`_ infrastructure, in particular their `project builder <https://lab.zooniverse.org/>`_ tool - which meant that the website could be put together with no cost except for the researcher time to build it.

A major change from previous citizen science transcription projects is that volunteers were not presented with a whole page to transcribe. Instead the page images were divided into subsections by the project team, and the task given to each volunteer was reduced to transcribe only a few numbers from a page fragment.

The 'Weather Rescue' project was led by `Ed Hawkins <http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~ed/home/index.php>`_. It used the `Zooniverse.org <https://zooniverse.org>`_ platform, development of which is funded by generous support, including a `Global Impact Award from Google <https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB/giving/impact-awards.html>`_, and by a grant from the `Alfred P. Sloan Foundation <https://sloan.org/>`_.

Costs and efficiency
--------------------

The financial cost of this project was limited to the researcher time needed to set up and run it. We estimate this at about a quarter of one climate scientist’s time over 9 months. Costing them at an arbitrary £70,000 per year gives a £15,000 management cost.

Each observation takes only a few seconds of volunteer time to transcribe, but each was done by 5 volunteers to ensure the accuracy of the result, so effort/ob. is around 30 seconds.

Lessons learned
---------------

* Citizen science does work for transcription of 'boring' weather-only documents. (We thought that :doc:`oldWeather <../oldweather/oldweather1+2/oldweather1+2>` was successful partly because the ship's logs it was transcribing contain records of human interest, as well as weather observations. But the DWR observations are data-only, and this project still worked well).
* Sub-dividing a page of observations so that each volunteer only needs to do a small task (instead of a time-consuming whole page) is a good idea.
* The `Zooniverse project builder <https://lab.zooniverse.org/>`_ tool works well.
