Summary
-------

The `original oldWeather project <http://old.oldweather.org/>`_ ran between 2010 and 2012, and set out to transcribe the observations made by Royal Navy ships in the period 1913-1923. The documents being transcribed were `Ship's logs, from the ASDM53 collection of the National Archives <http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C1762>`_ (`sample page image <http://oldweather.s3.amazonaws.com/ADM53-33269/ADM53-33269-018_1.jpg>`_). oldWeather was the first large-scale `citizen science <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science>`_ data rescue project, it ran in partnership with `Zooniverse <https://www.zooniverse.org/about>`_.

oldWeather launched with about 250,000 page images to be transcribed (this phase is referred to as oldWeather1). Another 100,000 similar images were added after the first year (oldWeather2), giving a total of about 350,000 pages from 305 different ships. The progress of the project is well, if rather eccentrically, documented on `the project blog <http://blog.oldweather.org>`_.

oldWeather was extremely successful: `More than 16,000 volunteers contributed <https://blog.oldweather.org/2012/09/05/theres-a-green-one-and-a-pink-one-and-a-blue-one-and-a-yellow-one/>`_, it produced around `8 million new weather observations <https://github.com/oldweather/oldWeather1/tree/master/imma>`_ (`1.6 million records <https://blog.oldweather.org/2012/07/23/one-million-six-hundred-thousand-new-observations/>`_ with a typical record including air temperature, wet-bulb temperaure, pressure, wind speed, wind direction, `a present weather code <https://blog.oldweather.org/2011/04/15/the-weather-in-1-85-characters/>`_ and sometimes sea-temperature and sea-state). As well as the rescued weather observations, the project had a substantial history component, producing `high-quality ship histories <https://www.naval-history.net/OWShips-LogBooksWW1.htm>`_ which are being adopted by the `National Museum of the Royal Navy <https://www.nmrn.org.uk/>`_. Also it spun-up a `very expert and engaged volunteer community <http://forum.oldweather.org>`_, lots of press and public interest, `prizes <https://blog.oldweather.org/2013/05/16/certificated/>`_ and `awards <https://blog.oldweather.org/2014/01/31/certificated-2/>`_, `interdisciplinary collaborations <https://blog.oldweather.org/2013/10/17/learning-from-our-experience/>`_, and it inspired other citizen-science transcription projects in many fields.

Because oldWeather was a success, we ran a :doc:`follow-on project <../oldweather3/oldweather3>`.
