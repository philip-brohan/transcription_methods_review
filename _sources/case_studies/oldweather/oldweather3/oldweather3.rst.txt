`oldWeather3 <http://classic.oldweather.org/>`_, also known as "oldWeather Arctic", or "oldWeather classic", was a follow-on project to the :doc:`original oldWeather <../oldweather1+2/oldweather1+2>`. It took essentially the same approach, but used a different set of original documents - `U.S. Government ships logbooks in the US ?National Archives <https://www.archives.gov/research/military/logbooks/navy>`_, concentrating on voyages to the Arctic. (`Sample image <http://oldweather.s3.amazonaws.com/ow3/final/USS%20Thetis/vol010of024/vol010_094_0.jpg>`_).

The project included 200,000 images, from only 18 different ships.
